NerdingCraft is a an educational project by me, Kyle VanderBeek. I
started playing with computers as a child (when the TRS-80 was
popular) and have been coding professionally since my first paying gig
in about 1993.

I love refining existing software as much as I enjoy creating it
anew. So when I started looking around the Minecraft modding community
for something to build, I found that there was an opportunity to just
make existing projects better and make the talented modders out there
more productive.

So I decided to apply my "nerding" (endless fiddling with software) to
this community.
