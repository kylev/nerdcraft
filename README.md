# NerdingCraft
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kylev/nerdingcraft.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/kylev/nerdingcraft)

This is a sandbox for understanding
[Minecraft Forge](http://minecraftforge.net), its
[Gradle](http://gradle.org/) build system, and the Maven-backed
dependency management.

This is the companion code to the documentation, articles, and
resources [here](http://kylev.github.io/nerdingcraft/).

Nobody should use this mod. I'm only using it to ensure that I can
provide good, professional software development advice to mod
creators, particularly as it relates to open-source.
