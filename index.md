I love developers, I love Minecraft, and I love the modding
community. Unfortunately, there are not enough mentors and teachers in
the modding world to help everyone become great developers.

This is a work in progress. These pages go along with an
[example mod on GitHub](http://github.com/kylev/nerdingcraft).

naming and communicating to your users with versioning.
